# Jupyter notebook runnable online via Binder (for MR club)

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/BitPupper/my-binder/master?labpath=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FBitPupper%2Fmy-binder%2Fblob%2Fmaster%2Fmain.ipynb)

Access this Binder by clicking the blue badge above or at the following URL:

https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/BitPupper/my-binder/master?labpath=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FBitPupper%2Fmy-binder%2Fblob%2Fmaster%2Fmain.ipynb

(NOTE: once you are redirected to JupyterLab, you may get an error saying the path was not found. Just click off of it and access the file manually by clicking the folder icon on the left bar and selecting the 'main.ipynb' file. Everything will be fine. ...I think.)

Binder is prone to server errors from my experience, so if you can't access the file with any of the links, try again after waiting a few minutes.

If all of the above fails, PM me and I'll try to figure it out.
