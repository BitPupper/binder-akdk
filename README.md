# Jupyter notebook runnable online via Binder (for MR club)

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/BitPupper/my-binder/master?labpath=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FBitPupper%2Fmy-binder%2Fblob%2Fmaster%2Fmain.ipynb)

Access this Binder by clicking the blue badge above or at the following URL (NOTE: once you are redirected to JupyterLab, you may get an error saying the path was not found. Just click off of it and access the file manually by clicking the folder icon on the left bar and selecting the 'main.ipynb' file. Everything will be fine. ...I think.):

If you can't access JupyterLab with the links above, try this link:

https://hub.gke2.mybinder.org/user/bitpupper-my-binder-9uggt5i7/doc/tree/main.ipynb

If that fails too, PM me and I'll try to figure it out.
