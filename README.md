Once you are redirected to JupyterLab, click the folder icon on the left bar and select the 'main.ipynb' file. That is where the main code is. Feel free to edit the code and play around with it. Edits won't change the source code, so don't worry about messing anything up.

If the links fail, try going to https://mybinder.org/ and inserting the following information in the fields:

Let me know if you encounter any errors.

Please ignore the seq-data folder for the time being! It contains faulty sequences.
