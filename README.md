# Jupyter notebook runnable online via Binder (for MR club)

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/BitPupper/my-binder/master)

Access this Binder by clicking the blue badge above or at the following URL:

Once you are redirected to JupyterLab, click the folder icon on the left bar and select the 'main.ipynb' file. That is where the main code is. Feel free to edit the code and play around with it. Edits won't change the source code, so don't worry about messing anything up.

If the links fail, try going to https://mybinder.org/ and inserting the following information in the fields:

Let me know if you encounter any errors.


In addition, there are also files containing the original and average-value sequences in the folder seq-data. You may use it to fetch the entries quickly without having to wait for the sequence generator code to finish running or view the numbers in all their glory. Keep in mind that the csv versions start at index 0, whereas I set the txt versions to start at index 1 to keep it consistent with the original problem/algorithm.
